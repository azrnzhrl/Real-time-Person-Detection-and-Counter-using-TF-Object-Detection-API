THESIS: A NON-INTRUSIVE APPROACH FOR INDOOR OCCUPANCY DETECTION IN SMART ENVIRONMENTS

DESCRIPTION: Work started from TensorFlow Object Detection API: Object detection tutorial codebase. Contributions made to have Real-time Human detection and Counter. 

Real-time domain is by implementing OpenCV to run with the model deployed.

System running on:

1. Windows 7 CPU 2.5GHx core i5

2. Jupyter notebook virtual environment

3. Installing Python, Tensorflow, Applying TensorFlow object detection API was done from scratch with the guidelines from https://github.com/pkulzc
